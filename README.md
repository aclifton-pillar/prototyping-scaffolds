# Prototyping Scaffolds

To help teams prototyping products move quickly to developing
features, a number of repositories have been created that
create scaffolds and examples.  Teams may spend days or weeks
on infrastructure and architecture that doesn't provide value
when they have short timelines.

To that end, a growing number of repositories are being
created that address common technical stack patterns and automation.

## Technical Stacks
* [Websocket with Redux (Third-Party Library)](https://github.com/aclifton-pillar/react-native-websocket-middleware-third-party)
* [Websocket with Redux (Our Own Implementation)](https://github.com/aclifton-pillar/react-native-websocket-middleware-scaffold)
* [Testing-Library/React versus Enzyme](git@github.com:hoff2-ACN/jest-vs-rtl.git)
